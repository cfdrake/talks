# Functional Introduction/Challenge

This repository contains a functional programming introduction (and small challenge) that I presented at [Dynamit](http://dynamit.com) on 2/24/2016. The language of choice is a small LISP dialect called [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)).

## Getting Started

To begin, start by reading the [Field Guide](https://github.com/cfdrake/functional-challenge/blob/master/field-guide.scm). This will get you acquainted with the various types of expressions available to you in the Scheme REPL.

Feel free to follow along and experiment in an online REPL, such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/Scheme).

## Challenges

*Assuming repl.it usage...*

When you are ready, open the [Challenges](https://github.com/cfdrake/functional-intro-and-challenge/blob/master/challenges.scm) file.

**Begin by copy and pasting The Cradle section into your code window!** This will provide you with a few helpful functions and aliases that should make your journey simpler. Press the `Run ▶` ︎button to load the definitions into your REPL.

As you tackle each challenge, copy and paste the comments and the skeleton code for each, one at a time, into your REPL. Try to work out a solution, press run, test it in the REPL, and move on once you are satisfied with your solution.

*Do not remove any previous challenges from your code window*. Most challenges will build upon the last and require your old definitions to be available.

Have fun!
