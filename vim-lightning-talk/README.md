### `quitQ!ZZwq!`: A Guide to Successfully Quitting Vim
This repository contains the slides/live demo for my lightning talk on [Vim](http://vim.org) given at [Dynamit](http://dynamit.com) on 11/18/2015.

#### Viewing the presentation
Begin by ensuring you have an (at least) 80x24 character terminal window open.

To view the presentation, run the following command:

    $ vim -S presentation.vim

This will load a Vim session with all of the slides loaded as separate buffers.

To navigate between slides, use `:bn` and `:bp` to go to the next and previous slides, respectively.

#### Notes
[Keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) was used to visualize keypresses during this presentation.
