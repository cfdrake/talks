        - Complex commands seem arbitrary... ciw, d$, dto, dt}, d%
        - Actually: easily composed of <verb><location> pairs

          Learn simple actions and locations - then compose them!

          - d$: delete to end of line
          - y$: copy to end of line

          - c$: change to end of line (delete and start in insert mode)
          - ciw: change inside of word

          - dto: delete up until the next "o"
          - dTo: delete backwards until the most recent "o"
          - dn: delete up until the next search term match
