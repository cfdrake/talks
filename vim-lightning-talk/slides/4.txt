    Basic editing (1/2)

        "Modal Editing" - normal (command), insert, visual, ...

        <esc>  Revert back to normal mode
        i      Enter insert mode from normal mode

        Normal mode ("movement"/location commands):

        j/k  Move up and down line-by-line - it's like WASD ;)
        h/l  Move right and left character-by-character
        w/b  Move forward/backward one word
        $    Jump to end of line
        ^    Jump to beginning of line
        :<N> Jump to line number N ("colon command")

        Insert mode - regular keyboard input, <c>/<tab> etc. may be bound
