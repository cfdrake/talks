    Quick history

        Lineage:

        - ed (1969): "the most user-hostile editor ever created"
        - vi (1976): graphical shell ontop of ex, an ed clone
        - vim (1991): open source clone of vi, ported to many systems

        Notes for the Modern Era:

        - 2015 CE: vi or vim in most Unixes usually puts you into Vim
        - Vim now comes with many improvements over vi:
            - Merge tools, plugins, GUIs, code folding, sessions, ...
        - Projects like NeoVim to rewrite/remove crust from the codebase
